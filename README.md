# sql-murder-mystery

## Important files in our repository:
- index.html: working template of our game content in HTML and Javascript (Julia)
- styles.css: styling for index.html (Julia)
- database.sql: database schema we will be copying into backend once it's created (Tom)
- sql-murder-mystery: react app we will be building out for our final game (Lia)


## Instructions for running sql-murder-mystery react app:
- install node.js
- run command `cd sql-murder-mystery` to enter app directory
- run command `npm install` to install relevant dependencies for app
- run command `npm start ` to launch app


## Next Steps:
- create a python backend in flask
  - connect to instance of sqlite database to allow SQL Injection
  - develop lightweight API to allow us to communicate results of SQL Injection from backend to frontend react app
